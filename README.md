# image-compression
This an example of Image Compression using Singular Variable Decomposition
This is Python Code that is based on work from the DeepLearning Academy - Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science

This code takes a bitwise Black and White Image and decomposed it using Singular Variable Decomposition
The code then reproduces the image with increasing clarity

This method is often used for image compression
